What's in it for me?

.. admonition:: tl;dr

    This section explains when it might be a good idea to try doing an x-ray absorption fine structure measurement.

Why should we do XAS if we can infer electronic structure from structures that we can solve using diffraction? Isn't EXAFS fake, anyway? What's the point in going to a synchrotron to measure XANES when we can do XPS at home?

When should I consider doing XAS?

XAS vs. XPS
-----------
It's certainly valid to treat XPS as a workhorse technique for figuring out electronic structure: as one example, we used it to tell apart Cr\ `sup`:III from Cr\ `sup`:VI. We can even use XPS to make inferences about local geometry.

However, not all cases are as easy to settle with certainty. Some oxidation states of Ag and Cu are notoriously difficult to differentiate by XPS alone since the photoelectron binding energies used for chemical shift analysis don't appear to follow intuitive or predictable trends.
