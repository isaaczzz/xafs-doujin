What is XAFS, really?
---------------------

XAFS means x-ray absorption fine structure. We like to talk about studying *the XAFS* to get information about electronic structure, geometry, and bonding in coordination complexes and porous network solids. More broadly, you might hear people call the technique "XAS" (x-ray absorption spectroscopy), which is also correct. I call it "XAFS" to emphasize the focus on *fine structure*, the details caused by nuanced modulations in the x-ray absorption probability.

Where does XAFS come from?
--------------------------

Due to Fermi's Golden Rule, the probability of an x-ray at a certain energy being absorbed by an atom depends on how many favorable final states are available after the initial excitation. The happier the atom can be with the number and respective probabilities of the final states, the more likely the atom is to absorb the x-ray.

XAFS is divided into two chunks of analysis: the near-edge fine structure and the extended fine structure. The x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) happens within around the first 200 eV of the absorption edge (the jump in absorption that happens when the x-ray energy crosses a characteristic orbital binding energy of the absorbing atom). The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) appears from the XANES region out to 1 keV or more from the absorption edge.

Why does the absorption edge look like that?
--------------------------------------------

Quantum mechanics says that atomic orbital binding energies are quantized. When we sweep the incoming (exciting) x-ray energy past the characteristic binding energy of an atomic orbital, the dominant absorption process happens because of the photoelectric effect: Electrons from the orbital are promoted to higher-energy states or kicked out of the atom entirely. Consequently, passing the binding energy, also called the threshold energy, results in a big jump in the measured x-ray absorption.

Overall, the measured absorption seems to fall off gradually after the edge jump. This is because competing processes, like Compton scattering, start to decrease the probability of x-ray absorption as the excitation energy gets farther from the absorption edge.
