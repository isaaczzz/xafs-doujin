About this guide

.. admonition:: tl;dr

    Get a copy of `XAFS for Everyone` by Scott Calvin and I'll tell you which sections to read.

This guide was originally written as an internal training manual for members of Beam Komachi, the XAFS beam team of the Jeff Long research group at UC Berkeley.

For practical things like hands-on data analysis with the Larch package, this guide is as self-contained as possible. But I don't think I can teach you theory better than the sentient animals portrayed in `XAFS for Everyone` by Scott Calvin.\ [#]_ I highly recommend grabbing a copy of the book (I used the 1st edition). I've included section references for targeted reading throughout this guide as much as possible.

Scott Calvin's book strikes the optimal balance between rigor and readability with judicious thought given to educating people with any level of expertise. As someone with an engineer's understanding of XAFS, I still use `XAFS for Everyone` as a frequent reference.

`EXAFS: Basic Principles and Data Analysis` by Boon K. Teo is a classic text for EXAFS theory.\ [#]_ While it's certainly not as fun as `XAFS for Everyone`, it's still a valuable reference text. Whenever I feel like I have a very specific question about the under-the-hood physics behind EXAFS, I usually end up searching the tome.

For a compact introduction to XANES, especially for 3d transition metals, the 1987 study of `Rhus vernicifera` lactase by Ed Solomon's group is a great reference.\ [#]_ Despite the specificity of the paper's title, the authors present a broad, detailed study of 59 Cu-containing complexes, systematically relating the geometry and physical oxidation state of each complex to features in the XANES. `XAFS for Everyone` provides a good comprehensive introduction to how to work with the XANES (including techniques like linear combination analysis), while the `Rhus vernicifera` paper exemplifies in detail how to link the fine structure to the electronic properties of different materials.
